# linefollower
A line follower robot is an electronic system that can detect and follow a line drawn on the floor. The robot uses IR sensors to sense the line, an array of 8 IR LEDs and sensors, facing the ground has been used in this setup. An IR sensor can be fitted near the patientâ€™s bed to which connection has been made with the robot too. The switch for it can be activated by the supply person in the microcontroller itself. If the switch is pressed then a flag bit is set in the microcontroller, from which the robot follows the line and reaches near the patient and provide the medicine to the patient. A proximity sensor can be attached with the robot so that it detects any obstacle present in their way and can alarm. The ability to get someone around the clock is the best thing that this system can do. This helps and simplifies the job of material supply and also reduces the manual routine work done by the hospital staff. This technology focuses on the delivery of safe, timely, efficient, effective, patient-centered health care.
